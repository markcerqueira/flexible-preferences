flexible_preferences
=====================

A simple Android project that illustrates how to use custom layouts with a PreferenceActivity,
programatically create and populate the preferences, and toggle the visibility of those preferences.

All of the magic is in **MainActivity** and **main_activity.xml**.

Built using Android Studio (1.0.2). Don't use Eclipse because it's bad.
